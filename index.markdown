## <i class="fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard"></i> Invited Talks
--------

###   **2022 Al Downe Memorial Lecture, _Queen's University_, Kingston, ON - March 2022**

*   Title: Editing Nature: Genetically Modified Mosquitoes and a Case for Slow Science
*   Description: Mosquito-borne diseases - malaria, dengue fever, zika, and others - are a significant burden on global health and economies. As such, a variety of interventions that target and reduce mosquito populations have been developed and used to manage disease transmission and its consequences. The advent of new genetic technologies, like CRISPR/Cas9, provide innovative solutions to mosquito control and have shown significant promise in reducing mosquito populations. However, these interventions require the release of genetically-modified mosquitoes into shared spaces and carry significant uncertainty and risk. The promise and peril of these interventions make them an excellent case study for how we do science, and how we ought to do science. Taking a "Slow Science" approach to editing nature can help ensure that it is done safely, ethically, and with the support of the communities involved.

###   Genomics in Medicine - Emerging Technologies and Bioinformatic Challenges, _Dalhousie University_, Halifax, NS. - December 2019

*   Title: Transposon Sequencing: Functional Genomics for Probing Bacterial Pathogenesis
*   Description: Transposon Sequencing is an emerging technique for discovering the functional outputs of different genomic regions within an organism's genome. In this talk, I outlined breifly what Transposon Sequencing is, how we use it in bacteria, and what we can learn from this technique, with a special focus on antibiotic resistance phenotypes and their associated liabilities in _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and Methicillin-resistance _Staphylococcus aureus_.

###   Graduate Student Research Day Excellence in Research Keynote, *Dalhousie University*, Halifax, NS. - May 2019

*   Title: *Vibrio parahaemolyticus* and infection: A complex relationship between environment and host
*   Description: *Vibrio* is able to live in the environment and proliferate as free-living or symbiotic organisms with a variety of hosts, but can also cause human infections. The links between this environmental survival and human infection in _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ still remain unclear. This talk described my work in the Thomas Lab with TnSeq and how we are looking at the question of how this organism can live as both an environmental organism and a human pathogen.

###   **Natural History Museum Life Science Seminar Series** - London, UK - January 2019

*   Title: The Multimodal Lifestyle of Marine _Vibrios_
*   Description: _Vibrio_ is a genus of marine bacteria which is able to survive and proliferate in a variety of niches, including as a human pathogen. My research aims to better understand these interactions by studying _Vibrio_ environmental survival, as well as their host-pathogen interactions.
